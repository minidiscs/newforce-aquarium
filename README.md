A website for Martin and his fish. Made for learning.

"So nice to meet you finally after all of those emails. Please, grab a chair," says Martin. He uses his leather loafer to gently nudge a chair slightly away from the table. He subtly waves his hand towards the chair in invitation.

You smile, pull the chair and out and start to slide your computer bag from your shoulder.

"Thanks, Martin."

You put your bag on the floor next to the chair and put your cup of coffee in the middle of the table, not far from Martin's. You note briefly that Martin got the largest size that the coffee shop offers, and it appears to be a latte.

"I'm glad to be able to help you build a site to track your amazing fish. When you sent me that email the other day listing all the ones that you have collected, I spent all night researching them. It was fascinating!" you exclaim.

Martin smiles widely, obviously pleased that you appreciate his achievements with his hobby.

You continue to pull your notebook and a pen out of your bag, and ask, <b>"So you said that you wanted multiple sections on your site - one that lists the fish you currently own, and another one that lists all the places that you've visited to collect the fish..."</b>

"Harvest the fish," Martin interjects with a forced smile.

"Sorry, where you harvested the fish." You restrain an eye roll.

You shift in your seat because the hard, wooden chairs are already becoming uncomfortable, and continue, "Is there anything you've thought of based on the example sites I sent you?"

Martin leans forward and put his hands on the table, "Actually yes. On the 'Fish Upon A Star' site, they had this <b>content on the right side of the list of fish that explained the process of keeping the tank clean and the water at the right salinity and temperature. I'd love to have that so I can put my thoughts in there."

You take notes as he talks and make sure that you jot down the you will need an <aside> element on that page.</b>

"All the sites had a navigation bar at the top. I'd like to have a navigation bar. Were you planning on having a navigation bar?" It's clear the way Martin places an emphasis on navigation bar that he's proud that he knows what that's called.

You smile slightly and say, "For you, I don't think it's needed since all the information is going to be on one page."

Martin frowns quickly, but recovers and says, "Hm, I suppose. Well, just make it look clean and minimal. Maybe when there is more information in the future, I can have you add another page and then I can have a navigation bar."

"Martin's been doing a little research on web stuff," you think as you pointedly write down 'Nav bar in future?' in your notes.

He patiently waits for you to finish jotting down these important notes, and then says, "Lastly, the 'Buoys and Gills' site had a part that listed travel tips for people who love to scuba and harvest fish. <b>On the page that lists all of the out-of-the-way places I've visited, I would like to provide a few quotes to help people."</b>

"Where would you like that to appear?" you ask briskly.

Martin responds, "Right above the list of locations."

You note that in your journal, then ask, "Ok, I just want to make sure I get this right for you.<b> The details of each fish should include the image, the species, its length, what you named the fish, where you harvested it, and what it eats... is that all correct?"</b>

"That sure is," he says confidently and leans back in his chair with his arms behind his head.

"Perfect!" you exclaim and then ask him if there's anything else he can think of now.

"No, I think that's enough to go on for now. Just make sure it's tasteful, since I'm fairly sure that I'll get lots of visitors to the site."

"Of course you will," you think as you smile and say, "I'll make sure all those people have a great experience on your site."

You both shake hands and you head back home to start work on the site.


<b>-1 year Later-</b>

A year has gone by since you built, and got paid for, Martin's fish site. You had nearly forgotten all about Martin and his odd requests until two nights ago when you received a strange phone call.

"Hi, it's Martin, and I really need to talk to you about my site. Something important has come up and I need some changes right away," he said in his hurried phone message. While he's talking, you hear a loud whirring, or whooshing, in the background. It makes it hard to understanding a few words in his message.

He continues in a rushed voice, "Look, I'll ***** home by tomorrow ***** and I'll meet ***** place at 7 pm. Coffee's on me this time."

That's the end of the message. You gather from how he ended it that he wants to meet at your usual coffee house to discuss his new idea.

The next night, you are sitting at your usual table when Martin's comes blustering into the coffee house. He looks different.

His usual neat appearance is gone. His hair is disheveled, and looks oily, you notice. His clothes are wrinkled and he is wearing boots covered in caked mud.

He spots you and huriedly comes to the table and sits down. In a breathless voice, he makes his request.

"I've made the most amazing discovery. It's going to turn the world of fish harvesting and care on its head." He runs his hand through his slick hair and says in a lowered voice, "I just returned from a trip to the Caribbean where I took a day trip inland to see the ruins of the city of Tikal."

"Wow, I've heard that it's beautiful. Do you have any..." he cuts you off mid-question.

"As I was deep inside one of the ruins, I wandered down this hallway. At the end was this enormous engraving of a fish. Only it wasn't just a fish. It was a logoglyph surrounded by other ones." Martin's eyes grow large and unfocused as he continues to recount his tale.

"Somehow, I just could understanding the writing, even though I'd never seen it before."

Your mouth drops open, even as you eyes narrow as you slowly start to suspect that Martin may have eaten some special herbs or mushrooms on his trip.

"It described the Holy Fish Jutz'kar and his followers. The most holy of his followers were always a multiple of 3 inches in length. They cared for Jutz'kar and fed him. The next holy were his soldier fish - swordfish - and they were all multiples of 5 inches in length. Some were even as large as 250 inches!!"

You grow more skeptical and say, "Um, aren't sword fish a lot longer than..."

It's like Martin has forgotten you are even sitting next to him. He continues, "So my site needs to pay homage to the Great Fish Jutz'kar and his servants. Any fish that is a multiple of 3 inches in length must be shown first. Then fish that are multiples of 5 inches must be shown next.

"What about fish that aren't that size?" you ask curiously.

Martin gives you a strange look, and for a second, you're afraid that he might say, "There won't be any of those... soon.", but he just waves his hand and says, "Display the rest in any order, since they are unworthy."
